  - title: "Crack Repair"
    content: "
Pavement Maintenance Services will evaluate the cause and state of pavement cracks. Where repair is reasonable, we will propose a repair. Usually this involves cleaning, drying, grinding/routing to widen the crack, removing dust, and applying sealant. Using a high grade, hot applied rubberized sealant, crack filling is the first step in extending the life of your blacktop surfaces. We provide clean, professional work that restores integrity to your blacktop surface that adheres to the surrounding pavement to keep water out.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Crack repairs significantly protects pavement and extends its lifetime cost effectively at a fraction of replacement cost, however it is rarely a permanent solution. We recommend periodic re-evaluation, anticipating replacement every 3-4 years. This can be extended by addressing subsurface conditions or providing a sealcoating to resist water infiltration.
