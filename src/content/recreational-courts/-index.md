  - title: "Acrylic Color Coatings"
    content: "
Our expert team uses industry leading materials and techniques to ensure your courts have the right look, traction, and bounce your athletes need to perform, protecting against weather, UV damage, and heavy use. We use the SportMaster acrylic color coating system for both new and existing courts that begins with any repairs that may be needed, then level with resurface base coat, then finish with at least 2 coats of finish in any combination of colors you choose.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

We can provide specialized surfaces beyond blacktop hard smooth surfaces. Specialized sand can be added in varying sizes and quantities to impact surface “speed.” Rubberized cushions with toughness hardeners can be applied for hockey or skating.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Whatever your needs, when your courts get our craftmanship, it’s game on.

  - title: "Crack Repair"
    content: "
Pavement Maintenance Services will evaluate the cause and state of pavement cracks. Factors that determine the appropriate method of crack repair for your courts, include the size, type, cause, and quantity of cracks. We eliminate the appearance of repaired cracks, using several options including acrylic patching of the cracks, RiteWay crack repair fabric, and patching the area with new blacktop. Cracks become common as courts age, our team will provide seamless repairs and the care it requires to prevent further damage and provide long lasting results.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

While no crack repair system is permanent, we will get your courts looking great and safe to play on. Without fabric reinforcement, we anticipate crack repairs will be required every 3 years; with fabric reinforcement, repair duration extends to 7-10 years.

  - title: "Patching"
    content: "
Pavement Maintenance Services can reduce water puddling and retention areas on your court, otherwise known as ‘birdbaths’, repairing them with a specialized acrylic patch, filling, and leveling compounds. Depending on the size, width, and depth of the areas in need of repair, we will apply material, sometimes in several layers, to level with the surrounding surface. Damaged blacktop may be removed and replaced with properly compacted subbase and blacktop.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Leveling the court improves gameplay, reduces further damage, and dries faster, increasing readiness after storms.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Our goal is to give you a safe court, true bounce, fast drying, and lasting results.

  - title: "Playing Lines"
    content: "
Crisp, bright, regulation playing lines  make your courts a delight to use and view. We can layout and stripe playing lines for many different types of surfaces, including pickleball, tennis, basketball, volleyball, hockey, badminton and many other types of recreational playing lines. All lines will meet regulation dimensions or as otherwise specified.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Line surfaces can be textured with varying roughness matching the rest of the playing surface to ensure similar bounce.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Acrylic striping paint engineered for court surfaces, applied with primer and several coats, enhance line appearance and longevity that we guarantee and warranty for 4 years.
